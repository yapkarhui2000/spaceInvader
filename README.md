# Space Invader Game
The project is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game "the Space Invader".
The project demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming, event handling, collision detection, and game loops.

# Project Overview
The player controls a spaceship that move horizontally at the bottom of the screen and shoot projectiles upward to destroy aliens.
Aliens in a line will move downward with increased speed when aliens reach the screen boundary and shoot bullets towards player with random interval.


# Technologies and Concepts
Programming language:Java

Game Architecture:

Game Loop – continuous loop that updates game state and renders graphics

Event Handling – key presses for player movement and shooting

Collision Detection – bounding box checks between bullets, aliens, and the player

Object-Oriented Design:

Player – handles movement, lives, and shooting

Alien – moves horizontally, shifts downward when reaching screen edge, shoots bullets

Bullet – manages position, direction, and collisions

GamePanel / Main – main loop, rendering, and input handling

Graphics & Rendering:

Java Swing/AWT components for drawing game objects

Double buffering for smooth rendering

# How to start

Step 1: git clone https://github.com/yapkarhui2000/spaceInvader.git

Step 2: cd spaceInvader

Step 3: Compile the source code

Step 4: Run the GamePanel
